/**
 * The new java.util.stream package has been added to JDK which allows us to perform "filter/map/reduce" like operations with the collections in Java8
 * 
 * A stream is something like an iterator. However, a stream can only be traversed once, then it’s used up. Streams may also be infinite, which
 * basically means that streams are “lazy” - we never know in advance, how many elements we will have to process.
 * 
 * One important thing to notice about Stream API is that the source data is not mutated during the operations. 
 * This is due to the fact that the source of the data might not exist as such, or the initial data might be required somewhere else in the application code.
 * 
 * The Stream API would allow us to declare either sequential or parallel operations over the stream of data
 *

	 * Stream.filter or Stream.map; and a terminal operation such as
