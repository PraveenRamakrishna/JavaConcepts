Map Interface, the only one that does not Inherit collection.

A Map is an object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys, Each key can map to at most one value.

The Java platform contains three general-purpose Map implementations: 
 - HashMap 
 - TreeMap
 - LinkedHashMap
 
 behavior and performance are precisely analogous to HashSet, TreeSet, and LinkedHashSet.
 
 
 The Map interface provides three collection views, which allow a map's contents to be viewed as 
 	- a set of keys, 
 	- collection of values or
 	- set of key-value mappings
 	
Note: great care must be exercised if mutable objects are used as map keys
